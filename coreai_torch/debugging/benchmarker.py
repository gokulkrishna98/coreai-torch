Benchmarker utility for profiling operation timing in AIProgram.

This module provides a framework for benchmarking ML model implementations by
measuring the execution time of each operation using the Profiler API from
standalone_swift and coreai-runtime.

Key components:
- Benchmarker: Main class for collecting and reporting operation timing
- BenchmarkResult: Data class containing timing information for operations
- CoreAIBenchmarker: Benchmarker implementation using Core AI Runtime
