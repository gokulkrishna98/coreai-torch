Structural diff on NetworkX graphs for AIProgram and PyTorch operations.

            separates the two.
        target_to_source_mapping: The same correspondence, inverted
        modified_node_pairs: Nodes that correspond but are not identical, as
            `(source, target)`. The same op, wired or configured differently -- a
            rewiring, a reshape, a changed attribute. Neither added nor removed,
            because it is still there and still in the same place in the source.

            it back to label a modified pair's *reason* under the same policy that

            and a reason computed under a different policy than the one that rejected
            the pair can describe the wrong thing: an IGNORE-computed label elides a
            parameter's value, so a DIGEST-only difference is invisible to it and the
            true reason (`attributes: ...`) is never reached.

    Lifetime: the two graphs hold `ir_object` references owned by the programs they
    were built from, and comparison reads them lazily. A `GraphDiff` is therefore
    only usable while both programs are alive -- dropping an `AIProgram` and keeping
    its diff segfaults the interpreter, with no Python traceback to say why.
