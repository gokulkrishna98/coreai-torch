"""
Aligning two program graphs, to report what changed.

Answers "which node became which", not "are these isomorphic" -- the diff is built
from the mapping, and a yes/no verdict says nothing about what differs. Linear time,
no search.

Five steps:

1. **Label** each node by what makes it that node, each edge by `(edge_type, index)`.
   The index matters because operand order is semantic: without it `sub(a, b)` and
   `sub(b, a)` look alike. Parameter payloads and symbol uniquifiers are excluded --
   they differ between two conversions of one unchanged model.
2. **Fingerprint** bottom-up over a node's label plus its operands' hashes, so equal
   hashes mean "computes the same thing from the same inputs". Labels alone cannot:
   every `add` in a model shares a label.
3. **Anchor** equal fingerprints, then **propagate** along dataflow slot by slot, so
   an edit costs what the edit is worth rather than the whole cone below it.
4. **Assign** the leftovers by shared neighbours, ignoring position -- the only pass
   that survives a move. See `_assign_residual`.
5. **Verify** every pair against the full label. Steps 2-4 are heuristics; this is
   what makes `identical` a proof. A failed pair is `modified`, not removed-plus-added,
   which would discard the identity and source line of an op that is still there.

Pairs are proposed on `structural_labels` (no result types, no payloads) and verified
against `node_labels`, so an op whose shape changed still pairs and reads as modified.

**Lifetime.** Labels read `ir_object` lazily at `align` time, so a graph is only usable
while its program is alive; dropping the `AIProgram` segfaults the interpreter.

    Whether a verified mapping proves the two graphs are the same graph.

    The whole argument: every pair in `verified` maps each operand to the
    corresponding operand, so every source edge maps to a distinct target edge. If the
    mapping is also a node bijection and the edge counts agree, that injection is onto
    -- an isomorphism, under labels.

    Comparing the two fingerprint *multisets* instead is not sound: a bottom-up
    fingerprint says nothing about how often a value is consumed, so a duplicated
    constant with one copy dead hashes exactly like a shared one.

            no meaningful cost, but only between programs this process produced;
